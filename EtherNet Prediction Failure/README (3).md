# EtherNet Prediction Failure

### For my analysis, I used a dataset containing two years of stock price fluctuations for ADANIENT, which I obtained from the official website of National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). To make predictions about future stock prices using machine learning, I performed cross-validation on the dataset and obtained a lower neg_mean_squared_error using the Linear Regression model. The accuracy rate of the model was an impressive 99.9%.

### The Linear Regression model was able to capture the underlying trends and patterns in the historical stock price data for ADANIENT, making it a highly reliable tool for predicting future stock prices based on the pattern of market value fluctuation. As investors, we can use this model to make informed decisions about our investments in ADANIENT, and better manage our investment portfolios.

### In summary, my analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Linear Regression models for predicting stock prices. By understanding the historical trends and patterns in the stock prices of a particular company, we can use this information to make more informed decisions about our investments. This can ultimately lead to better investment outcomes and a stronger investment portfolio.
