# Diabetes Prediction



This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes or not using machine learning classification techniques.

### Data
The dataset used for this project contains information about various medical factors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI, along with the target variable indicating whether the person has diabetes or not.

### Methodology
The data is first preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the features. Then, various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests are trained on the data to predict whether a person has diabetes or not. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

### Results
The results show that the machine learning models are able to accurately predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on the given medical factors. Further improvements can be made by tuning the hyperparameters of the models and using more advanced techniques such as ensemble methods.
